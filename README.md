# To-Do List

This is just a little to-do list website I created, still needs a little bit of work but the main functionality is there. Some of the main features of the website are that you can create a to-do list, and for each item in your list you can edit, delete, or check it completed. Another feature is that you can make a to-do list and it will save it to local storage. This means even if you close the tab, your to-do list will still be there. Lastly you can register for an account and it will store your information.

On the frontend, I'm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the backend, I'm using nodejs with express to create and use a server. I'm alse using the EJS view engine to create some dynamic HTML. Lastly, to store user information, I'm using MySQL.

In the future I'd like to increase functionality for the user when logged in.
